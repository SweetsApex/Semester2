      <h3>Physical Identifiers:</h3>
      <p>
        These creatures are often identified through a white spot on their
        foreheads, they're known to be red-brown or grey-brown in colour, with
        <br />
        large hind legs, large ears, and a short, fluffy-white tail. Their
        underside fur is often white, with a rusty patch on their tails.

      <h3>Common Habitat:</h3>

      <h5>Rabbit in its natural habitat:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Eastern Cottontail Rabbits are often found across the United
          States of America, southern Canada, Mexico, Central America, or
          northern South America.
        </li>
        <li>
          These rabbits are known to thrive in habitats such as open fields that
          are grassy, with supporting shrubbery / foliage for optimal survival.
        </li>
        <li>
          Males often occupy more land across their lifetimes (1.4 acres),
          versus their female counterparts (1.2 acres).
        </li>
        <li>
          As to be expected, breeding season greatly affects male movement
          throughout their lifetimes as they seek suitable mates.

      <h5>The Cottontail with its winter coat!</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Eastern Cottontail Rabbits often have a dark brown coat during the
          winter months. To optimally thrive throughout the winter, they will
          often stay in areas known to them with good vegetation in summer.
          Meaning they'll stay in known areas with lots of shrubbery, wood areas
          with good cover, dens / small holes, and especially shrubbery with
          surrounding walls / stones, pertaining to rabbits that live near
          cities.
        </li>
        <li>
          Ironically, these animals do not dig their own dens, they only situate
          their own nests for nursing.
        </li>
        <li>
          During the mating season, males will often fight one another to "win"
          a possible mate!
        </li>
        <li>
          The average Eastern Cottontail Rabbits lifespan is approximately 15
          months in the wild, while the longest recorded living was about 5
          years.
        </li>
        <li>
          These little sprinters can hop! They often top-out at 29km/h! While
          escaping a predator at their top speeds, they'll often maneuver left
          and right to throw off their scent trails.
        </li>
        <li>
          They're known to be creatures of prey, meaning they're more often the
          animals being hunted rather than the hunter! Due to their place on the
          food chain being lower, they are known to be herbivores, primarily
          consuming local vegetation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Despite being herbivores, in extreme cases, some rabbits have been
          known to consume arthropods which have been found in their pellets
          before!
        </li>
        <li>
          Regardless of their place on the food chain, these little guys are
          territorial! They will often fight other animals, including predators
          if they feel they have no other options with their powerful hind legs!
        </li>
        <li>
          Local threats can easily be sniffed out as these rabbits have up to
          100 million scent receptors and can twitch their nose up to 120 times
          per minute!
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>In Conclusion:</h2>
      <p>
        Eastern Cottontail Rabbits are very beautiful creatures, although they
        can be menacing when provoked. Thriving across North America, indulging
        <br />
        on local foliage and travelling minimally unless to seek food or a
        better mate, these little guys were a wonderful choice for this project
        <br />
        in my opinion! They often go unnoticed but are a very essential part of
        any ecosystem and are inherently beautiful animals. Thanks for taking
        the time to read this far if you have!
